## What is Attack and Farm
A fun game for crypto adoption and teaches the ethereum core values to users while playing.
Attack and Farm is a fully on-chain game exploring censorship resistance and governance.

The world is made up of 3 factions/guilds: 1. Cypherpunk; 2. Moloch; 3. Memecoin. The 3 factions represent 3 different ideologies and result in different gameplay.

We’d like to use this game to really show what’s going around us: the fight between ideologies, and also the people behind it, voting, doing their hard work, and make the player learns the governance from inside and out. It reminds you of your beliefs through the game.


## User Interaction
The player jumps in the game, verifies with World ID, and start participating in the game.

## Project Architecture
This project uses reactJS and PhaserJS (game animations) for the frontend and can be accessed from browsers. For the smart contracts, I have used remix for the deployment.

For the gameplay design, we’ve incorporated game designs from many trending traditional games, and the game is designed with the Public Goods values in mind.
